user_description: I'm a Computer Engineer from Argentina, always searching for the next challenge; no task is too scary nor too difficult. Lately I have been immersed in world of heavy equipment working with Wymaq, a Buenos Aires based startup trying to improve the world through digitizing the rental and management of heavy machinery. I'm the first engineer they hired to work on the platform.
